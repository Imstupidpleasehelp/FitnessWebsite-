Although I had a training plan from my first time around, I really wanted a coach to get me through it again. I was not just looking for someone who could provide me with a training plan but someone who knew when adjustments needed to be made. That's where Skyler came in. She had an option for a training plan with weekly check-ins and that was exactly what I needed...When I had concerns over my swim (when didn't I have concerns??) she reached out to not only give me pointers for improving my technique and time but also tips for helping me calm down because I was having anxiety issues. If I wasn't ready for a particular workout (descents on the bike scare me) she adjusted my schedule to put it off until I was ready. All around, Skyler was just a great fit for me. She had more faith in my ability to get through this race than I did! We had a great rapport and I really enjoyed having her as my coach!"
